# Streaming Data Importer

For all intents and purposes, this repo currently stands as an exact copy of dwp/kafka-to-hbase. This is intentional.
Intended to be a new application, the streaming data importer, will be a refactor of kafka-to-hbase. 

In order to build out the repo, infrastructure and pipelines necessary to aid the development of this new application, it was decided that an exact copy of kafka-to-hbase code base would be used.
